# Jet Lag HS Portal

A web portal created for coordinating my friend group's hide-and-seek game in Tel Aviv. While inspired by the Jet Lag format, this is a personal implementation for our private game sessions. The codebase can be adapted for similar games in other cities.

## ⚠️ Important Notice

This is an **unofficial**, fan-made project for personal use. We are not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to the official Jet Lag series or its creators. This is a tool created for my friend group's games in Tel Aviv, though others are welcome to adapt it for their own local games.

- Visualizing our game boundaries in Tel Aviv
